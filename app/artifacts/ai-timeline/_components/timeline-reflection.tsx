                Through this timeline project, I developed a much clearer understanding of the long and layered history of artificial intelligence. I was surprised to learn that many core ideas in AI - like natural language processing and neural networks - were already being explored as early as the 1950s. Programming languages like LISP and early rule-based systems such as ELIZA helped shape foundational directions for AI. I also realized how progress in AI has not been linear: between the 1970s and 1990s, development stagnated, and it wasn’t until breakthroughs in hardware and deep learning around the 2010s that AI became truly powerful in practice. Tools like GPT-3 only recently made AI more widely accessible and visible to the general public, which made me reflect on how long it takes for foundational research to reach practical application.

                In terms of group work and overall execution, our team focused on clear division of tasks and effective communication. We started with brainstorming sessions, after which each member worked on a specific portion of the timeline. The project flowed smoothly without major obstacles, largely because we adhered to the “keep it simple, stupid” (KISS) principle and used tools that were easy to manage and visually effective. This experience reminded me that simplicity - when paired with thoughtful design - can lead to clarity and impact. Overall, I found the project both informative and rewarding, as it not only deepened my knowledge but also gave me a positive collaborative experience.
