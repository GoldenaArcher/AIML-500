          Neural Networks: The Foundation of Deep Learning

          A neural network is a computer system inspired by the way the human
          brain works. Itâ€™s made up of layers of tiny processing units (called
          "neurons") that are connected to each other. Each of these units takes
          in information, processes it, and passes it along to the next layer.

          Think of it like a team of decision-makers. Each person (neuron) adds
          a bit of insight and passes their opinion forward.

          What is Deep Learning?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2">
          <strong> Deep learning </strong> is a subfield of machine learning
          that uses <strong> neural networks with many layers </strong>. The
          "deep" refers to the fact that there are multiple layersâ€”each one
          learning increasingly abstract features of the input data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2">For example:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2">
          <li>Layer 1 learns edges</li>
          <li>Layer 2 learns shapes</li>
          <li>Layer 3 learns objects (like eyes or wheels)</li>
          <li>Final layer makes the decision ("This is a cat!")</li>
        </ul>

          Why Are Neural Networks Essential to Deep Learning?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-2">
          Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. The more layers
          you stack, the more powerful the system becomes in recognizing
          patterns.

          Without neural networks, deep learning wouldnâ€™t exist.

          Neural networks are the core structure behind deep learning. By
          stacking layers of neurons, we create systems that can see, hear, and
          even speak.
