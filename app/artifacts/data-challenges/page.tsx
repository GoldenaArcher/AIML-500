 * ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Availability

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	Data from niche domains or novel applications is often scarce.
    â€¢	Privacy concerns or regulation (e.g., medical, finance) may limit access.
    â€¢	Siloed data across departments or organizations prevents sharing.

â€¢ Impact
    â€¢	Underrepresentation of rare scenarios leads to biased or overfitted models.
    â€¢	Limited data hampers model robustness and generalization.

â€¢ Possible Solutions
    â€¢	Apply data augmentation or synthetic data generation.
    â€¢	Use transfer learning or pre-trained models to bootstrap performance.
    â€¢	Establish cross-team or inter-org data sharing agreements.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 6. Data Imbalance

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	Some classes are heavily overrepresented compared to others.
    â€¢	Skewed distribution leads to model bias toward majority classes.

â€¢ Impact
    â€¢	Poor performance on minority classes.
    â€¢	Inflated accuracy due to ignoring rare but important outcomes.

â€¢ Possible Solutions
    â€¢	Use resampling techniques (over/under sampling).
    â€¢	Assign class-weighted loss functions.
    â€¢	Generate synthetic samples using SMOTE or similar tools.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 7. Data Scalability

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	Large datasets are hard to store and process efficiently.
    â€¢	Training on massive data requires distributed systems.

â€¢ Impact
    â€¢	Increased compute cost and latency.
    â€¢	Infrastructure complexity slows down model iteration.

â€¢ Possible Solutions
    â€¢	Leverage cloud computing and distributed storage (e.g., Spark, Hadoop).
    â€¢	Apply data sharding and partitioning strategies.
    â€¢	Optimize pipelines with batching and streaming.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 8. Data Versioning and Management

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	Tracking changes in datasets over time is complex.
    â€¢	Inconsistent versions between dev and prod can cause issues.

â€¢ Impact

    â€¢	Use data versioning tools (e.g., DVC, LakeFS).
    â€¢	Log data hashes and metadata with each model artifact.
    â€¢	Automate dataset change detection in CI/CD.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 9. Data Integration

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	ML often requires combining data from varied sources (structured, real-time, etc.).
    â€¢	Merging disparate formats and schemas is non-trivial.

â€¢ Impact
    â€¢	Inconsistent inputs reduce model reliability and performance.
    â€¢	Data fusion errors can cascade into training defects.

â€¢ Possible Solutions
    â€¢	Standardize schemas and use middleware or ETL tools.
    â€¢	Validate data after merging for consistency.
    â€¢	Use feature stores for unified access.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 10. Data Drift

â€¢ Challenge
    â€¢	Over time, input data distributions can shift.
    â€¢	Drift may go unnoticed in dynamic environments.

â€¢ Impact
    â€¢	Model performance degrades in production.
    â€¢	Predictions become unreliable as real-world context evolves.

â€¢ Possible Solutions
    â€¢	Monitor data with drift detection tools (e.g., Evidently, NannyML).
    â€¢	Periodically retrain models on new data.
    â€¢	Use online learning where appropriate.
